As discussed, we will be launching several resources for this workshop on your behalf in order to simplify examples.

If you are walking through this workshop on your own, download
this [CF Template](/repo_pmt_ws-fcj-005/resources/kinesis-immersion-day-cfn.yaml) to get started.
This CloudFormation template will launch the following resources (corresponding to the architecture below)

* A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Corresponding security groups for your Cloud9 Instance.
* A Cloud9 Instance to run the Kinesis Client Library and explore code
* Two S3 buckets to store your source Taxi Trip dataset, and accept the output of your curated data in the Kinesis Data
  Firehose lab
* A Kinesis Data Analytics Studio application and an associated Glue Database
* A Lambda function to process data from Kinesis Data Streams

### CloudFormation

* This can be achieved by either searching CloudFormation at the top of the page, or finding it in the â–¼Services button
  at the top left.

* On the CloudFormation page, let's click on Create Stack with new resources, and upload our CloudFormation .yml file.

* Upload the file and click on **Next**.

  Give the workshop template a name, like **kinesis-ws** so that it is easy to remember, and update the Parameter
  called **input-stream** if you created a stream with a different name. Click on **Next** again.

  CloudFormation template. Then, **Create Stack!**
